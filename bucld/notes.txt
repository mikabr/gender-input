more about points of freq diff slide
confidence intervals
probability ratio strata (contour lines)
where's "he"?


say colour mapping early

directions of causation / inter-relationship (girls talk more -> parents talk more customized)

line saying that no WG produces because floor

clearer framing of the question
what are you implying...
questions we would want to ask -- what we can answer, what we can't?
causation circularity earlier
sharpen item differences question -- child interest? parent talk?
slide: why are there these differences, circular arrows


comment on the overall girl-advantage more

mention CDI correlation with vocab size
distributions of slopes and intercepts?
speaking style diffs

bunch of examples of trajectories
label dotplot "number of words"

take out LLR math (and whole slide?)

axis labels in relationship plot too long -> reduce to bare minimum of directions
or say verbatim?
build

WG/WS acronym intro
mention prediction approach (AoA from frequency, etc)

explain the star thing explicitly
